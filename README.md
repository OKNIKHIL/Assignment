# Assignment
The purpose of this analysis is to examine meal service data for the month of December 2024. We will focus on key performance indicators like customer ratings, popular meal types, the timing of meals served, cancellations vs completions, and customer trends. This data will help us identify areas of improvement and opportunities for growth.

Key Insights
1. Meal Type Distribution
From the dataset, the meals served are primarily categorized as Dinner, Lunch, and Breakfast. Here's what I found:

Dinner is the most popular meal, with a significant number of meals served during the evening, followed by Lunch.
Breakfast meals are the least ordered in comparison.
Key Insights:

Peak Times for Dinner: A larger portion of our customers prefer dining during dinner hours. This suggests that we have an opportunity to focus on Dinner-related services.
Recommendations:

I would recommend prioritizing Dinner meal offerings by ensuring that inventory and staffing are well managed in the evening.
It might also help to promote Dinner during peak hours to maximize revenue.
2. Meal Ratings by Category
In terms of customer satisfaction:

Breakfast meals had lower ratings (around 4.1-4.2).
Dinner and Lunch have a slightly higher rating of around 4.5-4.9.
Key Insights:

Customer Ratings Trend: Higher customer satisfaction is associated with Dinner and Lunch offerings. The lower ratings for Breakfast meals could indicate room for improvement.
Recommendations:

I would suggest focusing on improving the Breakfast menu—potentially introducing variety or gourmet versions to increase appeal.
3. Meals Served by Time of Day
We see the following trends based on the time of meal service:

Morning (Breakfast): Mostly low order count.
Afternoon (Lunch): Somewhat moderate, with consistent orders.
Evening (Dinner): Peak demand.
Key Insights:

Quieter Afternoons: The lunch hours are less busy compared to dinner, suggesting a lull during mid-day.
Recommendations:

It would be beneficial to introduce limited-time deals during lunch hours to increase meal orders and customer engagement.
We could offer discounts for lunch orders or introduce light, quick meals for customers looking for something fast.
4. Cancellation vs. Completed Meals
The analysis of cancellations is interesting because:

We noticed a significant number of meal cancellations, especially in the Dinner category.
However, the number of completed meals is still far higher, showing operational consistency and satisfaction with the meals delivered.
Key Insights:

Cancellation Trends: Specific meals like Grilled Chicken had a higher cancellation rate. There might be a mismatch in customer expectations or availability issues.
Recommendations:

I'd suggest investigating the cause of these cancellations—whether due to delays, unavailability, or customer behavior—and working to reduce these by improving service during peak times.
A strategy for customer retention after a cancellation, like offering a discount on the next meal or sending a feedback request, might help prevent lost customers.
5. Customer Demographics
We can also see some patterns when it comes to customer demographics:

Customers like Bob Smith (35 years old) from Los Angeles and Grace King (38 years old) from Boston have higher meal engagement.
There is a clear trend in young to middle-aged adults predominantly ordering dinner meals.
Key Insights:

The average customer appears to prefer familiar comfort foods during Dinner hours.
Recommendations:

It's clear that providing options catered to a busy, working professional audience will be critical, such as meal combos or meal plans targeted at professionals, which can be ordered in advance or set for quick preparation.
